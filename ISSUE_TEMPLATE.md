*As GitHub currently only supports uploading of images, you will have to
upload your your savegames to an another source such as
[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com), [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com),
or [SkyDrive/OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com). Add the link to the file
to your issue and make the file(s) public, so we can access your gamelog or
savegame. The most important thing is to not remove these files after you
uploaded them!*
